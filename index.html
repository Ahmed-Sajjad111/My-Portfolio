                        I have been working in the IT industry professionally for about 5 years now. However I have been stacking my technical skills on a foundation that was built when I was very young. My skills include but are not limited to are: extensive knowledge on windows operating systems and their hardware (Building, Initiliazation, Deployment, Technical Support, and Repair), Network Attached Storage, and Networking. I am currently enrolled to become certified in the University of Minnesota's Full Stack Web Development Program.

                        My non-technical related skills include project/time management, working in any group size, and a huge understanding of a leadership role. These skills were built on a foundation that was created during my time in a nation-wide recognized JROTC program. I held the leadership role of Battalion Commander, the highest rank in our program, dedicated to develop and lead our entire program. During my time at Gravity Vault Indoor Rock Gyms I also learned to lead, delegate, and work with people outside of a school setting - with all different types of people and personalities. I held multiple roles but the most major was lead party planner; this gave me the oppurtunity to work with and delegate my peers, as well as interact with and communicate with groups as small as 4 people to almost over 200 people at once.

                        I am a gamer at heart- this consumes most of my free time. I am not a typical one-genre gamer, I find enjoyment from almost every game out there. However when I am not crushing the virtual playing ground you can typically find me hanging out with my friends eating food or on some adventure. I used to be an expert climber but have been away from that for a while- I'm looking to get back at it soon.

                        My final goal is to become a game developer, maybe start off by working at a small company, growing to work in a larger company that handles AAA titles, and then eventually create my own company and game. There isn't anything I love more than games, and to develop my own some day would be the goal of a lifetime - one I intend on accomplishing very soon.
